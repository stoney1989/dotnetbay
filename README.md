# dotnetbay - A .NET Auction Solution 
Master: [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/tf8958iu1ena3gvoljhb?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/stoney1989/dotnetbay)

A bootstrap solution to build your own basic auction portal

## Goals
This is the starting point for various extensions to the core business library. The current storage implementation is done by serializing data to json-files. There is no graphical user interface, just a command line.

With focus on the .NET-Stack, at least the following technologies should be added to extend the base implementation.

* WPF / XAML UI
* EntityFramework
* ASP.NET MVC 4 UI 
* ASP.NET WebApi
* ASP.Net SignalR
